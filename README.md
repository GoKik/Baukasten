# Baukasten
A simple GUI-Library for Processing. Adds some GUI-Elements to your Processing-Sketch. Works with both Java- and Android-Mode.

This Library is a remake of the "stiftUndCo" and "knopfUndCo" Library. It's ment to be used by the beginning informatik course of my school to learn Java with Processing.

Contains those Elements:

Stift: Pencil to draw on the screen.
Knopf: Simple Button with mouse animations.
Wahlbox: Simple Checkbox.

Planned:

Slider
Checkbox-Group
Textbox
