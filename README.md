# Toolbox
A simple GUI-Library for Processing. Adds some GUI-Elements to your Processing-Sketch. Works with both Java- and Android-Mode.

This Library is a remake of the "stiftUndCo" and "knopfUndCo" Library. It's ment to be used by the beginning informatik course of my school to learn Java with Processing. It is much customizeable and easy to use.

Contains those Elements:

Pencil: Pencil to draw on the screen.
Button: Simple Button.
Checkbox: Simple Checkbox.
CheckboxGroup: Put some Checkboxes together.
Slider: Slide to a value.
Textbox: Enter Text.
Tab / TabContainer: Set different Layouts and switch between them.
